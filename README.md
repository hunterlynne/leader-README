1. Overview
   a. This is some background of what to expect working together and what it’s like working on our team.
2. About me

a.       Love continuous improvement and transforming weaknesses into strengths.

b.       Big fan of perseverance.  See: Wooden, John for inspiration.

c.       This is the leadership style I try to emulate (per Lao Tzu): “As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence.  The next best, the people honor and praise.  The next, the people fear; and the next, the people hate...  When the best leader’s work is done the people say, ‘We did it ourselves!’”  I want to be the best leader.

d.       Married 18 years with three daughters and a 95lb English Lab.  Live in San Marcos, CA.  Former surfer and 15 handicap golfer.  Play recreational softball once per week.  Top website you’ll find in my browser history: Hacker News.

3.       Personal principles

a.       Basic premise: life is short.  Let’s make work fun or interesting every day (unless you’re really into Sisyphean tasks?).

b.       Honor the company’s values, but live yours at work.  Be yourself.

c.       When you are you, your engagement will grow exponentially.  This will build discretionary effort and better business outcomes.

d.       When you are you, you can connect and communicate with others in asymmetric, non-corporate ways (have real discussions about the heart of the issue). 

e.       When you are you, there’s less reliance on bureaucracy that suffocates creativity and doesn’t efficiently solve problems.

4.       Approach to work

a.       Understand top priorities of the business and our customers.

b.       Establish clear R&Rs for the team and our partners.

c.       Develop and update roadmaps.

d.       Find easy wins and simplify where possible.

e.       Implement on-time and accurately.

f.        Follow-up until complete.
